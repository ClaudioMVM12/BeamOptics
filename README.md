# Beam Optics

This program its for study beams optics with didactic proposes. It has numerical simulations for the intensity and other parameters of:

### Gaussian Beam;

* 2D Intensity heat map with Width
* 3D Intensity surface plot

### Hermite-Gaussian Beam;

* 2D Intensity heat map for visualize the modes of vibration
* 3D Intensity surface plot

### Laguerre-Gaussian Beam;

* 2D Intensity heat map for visualize the modes of vibration
* 3D Intensity surface plot

### Bessel Beam.

* 3D Intensity surface plot

 It has the possibility of change the standard parameters (by code) to perform others situations.

 ## Instalation

 It requires _numpy_, _scipy_, _scipy.special_, _matplotlib.pyplot_ and _mpl_toolkits.mplot3d_ to run this code.
